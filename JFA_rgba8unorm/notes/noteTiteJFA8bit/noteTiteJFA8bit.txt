JUMP FLOOD ALGORITHM - RGBA8UNORM
	by Tero Hannula for Cookbook jam.

Dimensions must be between 1 to 256, as values are stored 8bit accuracy.
	- Maximum size is then 256 x 256. 
	- Given seed texture is scaled down.

Coordinate is XY coordinate to closest seed.

Surfaces:
	temp	General helper surface for calculations. Kept alive to avoid recreating.
	coord	Coordinate mapping. 
			-> Closest coordinates for seed are stored in RG components.
			-> Closest coordinates for reverse seed are stored in BA components.
	fill	Fills empty areas with seed, which approximates Voronoi Diagram.
	field	Normal and signed distance field. 

Method calls should be done in Draw-events, as this uses shaders for calculations.

Uses builder pattern.
	- Methods return struct itself, so mehtod calls can be chained.
